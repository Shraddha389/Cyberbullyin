# Cyber-bullying Classification

This is a Kaggle project based on Machine Learning. The objective of the project is to analyse a general tweet statement and determine if it is a cyber-bullying tweet or not. If the tweet relates to a context of bullying, then assign the appropriate class of cyber-bullying.

This is a multi-class classification task which is related to the domain of Natural Language Processing(NLP).
    
## Data:
- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/cyberbullying-classification)
- A CSV file that provides more than 47000 tweets labelled according to the class of cyber-bullying.
- There are two columns in the dataset:
    - `tweet_text` - contains the tweet
    - `cyberbullying_type` - contains the corresponding cyberbullying class for each tweet (6 classes):
        - `age`
        - `ethnicity`
        - `gender`
        - `religion`
        - `other_cyberbullying`
        - `not_cyberbullying`

> Note:
>   
> These tweets either describe a bullying event or are the offense themselves, therefore explore it to the point where you feel comfortable.
